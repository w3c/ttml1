edition</loc>. A list of the substantive changes applied since that previous edition is found at <loc href="ttml1-changes.html">ttml1-changes.html</loc>. No feature was added.</p>

<p>For this specification to exit the CR stage, at least 2 independent implementations of every <loc>CR exit criteria test</loc> is required, as documented in the Working Group's <loc>implementation report</loc>. The Working Group does not require that implementations are publicly available but encourages them to be so.</p>
