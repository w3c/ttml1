<p>This edition of the Timed Text Markup Language (TTML) 1.0
<bibref ref="ttml10"/> clarifies ambiguities and corrects errors identified in the 
<loc href="&prevrec;">previous
edition</loc>, which this edition supersedes. No feature is added or removed in this edition.</p>

<p>For this specification to exit the CR stage, at least 2 independent implementations
of every <emph>CR exit criteria test</emph> are required, as documented in the Working
Group's <loc href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/TTML1-3ED_implementation_report">implementation report</loc>. These <emph>CR exit criteria tests</emph> are intended to cover
the ambiguities and errors corrected by this edition, and the implementation report will be limited to these tests. The Working Group does not require 
that implementations are publicly available but encourages them to be so.</p>

<p>Substantive changes applied since the <loc href="&prevloc;">previous version of this specification</loc> are listed at 
<loc href="substantive-changes-summary.txt">substantive-changes-summary.txt</loc>.</p>
