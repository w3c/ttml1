<loc href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/TTML13ED/">AC review survey</loc> by 1 November 2018.</p>

<p>This edition of the Timed Text Markup Language (TTML) 1.0
<bibref ref="ttml10"/> clarifies ambiguities and corrects errors identified in the 
<loc href="&prevrec;">previous
edition</loc>, which this edition supersedes. No feature is added or removed in this edition.</p>

<p>Please see the Working Group's <loc href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/TTML1-3ED_implementation_report">implementation report</loc>.</p>

<p>The implementation report documents that there are at least 2 independent implementations 
of every <emph>CR exit criteria test</emph>. Those <emph>CR exit criteria tests</emph> are intended to cover
the ambiguities and errors corrected by this edition, and are limited to those tests. The Working Group does not require
that implementations are publicly available but encourages them to be so.</p>
